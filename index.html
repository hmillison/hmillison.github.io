    <p>
      I work as a Software Engineer at
      The Infatuation
      in the greatest city in the world.
      Previously, I worked on anti money laundering applications at Bloomberg LP and social media campaign planning software at Sprout Social.
    </p>
    <p>
      My expertise is in Javascript and other front end technologies. However, I never shy away from working across the stack to
      get things done! I love being a part of the vibrant frontend community as we figure out the best practices for designing
      complex web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an academic background in Human Computer Interaction and Computer Science, I have a passion for the intersection of
      design and development.
    </p>
    <p>
      When i'm not writing code, you can find me making beats and taking pictures of my cooking.
