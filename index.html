    <p>
      I am a software engineer living in the greatest city in the world working with businesses of all shapes and sizes to solve their problems with technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've tackled a range of technical problems like
        high performance UI for monitoring distributed systems at scale,
        anti money laundering applications for investment banks, and
        social media campaign planning software for some of the worlds biggest brands
    </p>
    <p>
      My expertise is in Javascript, React, Vue, Typescript and other front end technologies. However, I never shy away from working across the stack to
      get things done! I love being a part of the vibrant frontend community as we figure out the best practices for designing
      complex web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an academic background in Human Computer Interaction and Computer Science, I have a passion for the intersection of
      design and development.
