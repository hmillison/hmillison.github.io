    <h1>
      Hello!
      <br /> My name is Henry Millison.
    </h1>
    <p>
      I work as a Software Engineer at
      <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/product/entity-exchange/" target="_blank">Bloomberg LP</a>
      in the greatest city in the world, New York City!
    </p>
    <p>
      My expertise is in Javascript and other front end technologies. However, I never shy away from working across the stack to
      get things done! I love being a part of the vibrant frontend community as we figure out the best practices for designing
      complex web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an academic background in Human Computer Interaction and Computer Science, I have a passion for the intersection of
      design and development.
    </p>
    <p>
      When i'm not writing code, you can find me making beats and taking pictures of my cooking.
    </p>
